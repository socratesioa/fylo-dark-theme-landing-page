## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Dart Sass (https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass)

### What I learned

I used this challenge to practice Sass. It was very helpful as this challenge provided a few challenges with the layout shifts.

### Continued development

As with every challenge I do I try to improve a bit on something. In this one, the layout shifts were a bit challenging but I managed to work through them methodically. Also improved my form validation skills.
